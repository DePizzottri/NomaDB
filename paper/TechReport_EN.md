### Abstract.
The approach to minimize memory consuption of data causality traching mechanism is proposed. Syncronization chemes that forms partially ordered set of dimention two are explored and the algorithm of checking the poset for being of dimension two is described. There was found and described some general and specific schemes, in wich there is a possibility to make such cauality tracking mechnisms.
